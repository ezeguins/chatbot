# Test RAG Chatbot

This project aims to implement the state-of-the-art techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our primary objective is to collaboratively engage in a hands-on, end-to-end project that leverages the latest advancements in the LangChain library <img src="img/langchain.png" alt="Description" width="20"/>.Additionally, we focus on the interaction with the vector database Pinecone <img src="img/pinecone.png" alt="Description" width="15"/> 
 ensuring a cutting-edge approach to data management and retrieval.

## Introduction

Welcome to the ChatBotRAG project, where we embark on a journey to showcase the cutting-edge advancements in conversational AI technology. Our primary goal is to demonstrate the state-of-the-art capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to create more contextually relevant responses.

At the heart of our project lies the integration of advanced tools and technologies. We leverage the Vector Database Pinecone, a high-performance, scalable solution for storing and querying high-dimensional vector data. By harnessing the power of Pinecone, we ensure rapid and efficient retrieval of relevant information to enrich the conversational experience.

Additionally, we utilize the LangChain library, a sophisticated toolkit that empowers us to implement the latest advancements in natural language processing. With LangChain, we can seamlessly integrate state-of-the-art language models and techniques into our chatbot, enabling it to understand and generate human-like responses with unparalleled accuracy and fluency.

To bring our project to life, we employ a Flask Python server, providing a robust and flexible platform for hosting our chatbot. The Flask server acts as the backbone of our system, facilitating communication between the user interface and the backend components, ensuring smooth and seamless interactions.

Furthermore, we have enriched our database by loading the author's Curriculum Vitae (CV) and postgraduate thesis. By incorporating this valuable information into the database, we enhance the chatbot's ability to provide insightful and relevant responses, tailored to the user's queries and interests.
